Overview:

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to recognize emotions from audio signals. 
The model leverages a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers 
to extract features and capture temporal dependencies in the audio data. 
The primary objective is to classify audio samples into one of six emotion categories

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of audio files labeled with corresponding emotions. Each audio file undergoes preprocessing, including:
•	Feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
•	Data augmentation techniques like time-stretching and pitch-shifting

Preprocessing Steps:
1.	Feature Extraction: Extract MFCC features for each audio sample.
2.	Data Augmentation: Apply transformations to increase the dataset size.
3.	Normalization: Scale the features using StandardScaler for better model performance.
4.	One-Hot Encoding: Encode the emotion labels for compatibility with the model.

Model Architecture:
The model architecture combines the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the sequence modeling power of LSTMs. The architecture includes:
1.	Convolutional Layer:
    1.	Extracts spatial features from the input data.
    2.	Kernel size: 5, Filters: 256, Activation: ReLU.
2.	LSTM Layers:
    1.	Captures temporal dependencies in the sequential data.
    2.	Four LSTM layers with 128 units each.
3.	Fully Connected Layers:
    1.	Processes the flattened feature vector.
    2.	Includes dropout layers for regularization.
4.	Output Layer:
    1.	Dense layer with 6 units and softmax activation for multiclass classification.



Challenges:
1.	Low accuracy due to class imbalance and insufficient data.
2.	Overfitting during training.

Potential Improvements:
1.	Data Augmentation:
o	Increase the diversity of the dataset using additional augmentation techniques.
2.	Hyperparameter Tuning:
o	Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer configurations.
3.	Model Architecture:
o	Add more LSTM layers or experiment with bidirectional LSTMs.
4.	Regularization:
o	Implement techniques like dropout and L2 regularization.
5.	Pretrained Models:
o	Use pretrained audio feature extraction models like Wav2Vec or OpenL3.
